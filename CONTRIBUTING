## Pull Request Process

* Keep PRs focused and small. Large PRs are harder to review.
* Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main` before opening the PR.

  ```bash
  git pull origin main --rebase
  ```
* Run `pnpm build` to confirm that the project builds successfully.
* PR titles should follow the **Conventional Commit** format.
* Once reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

---

## Code Style

* Follow the existing code style.
* Use **TypeScript** for all logic and components.
* Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (avoid inline styles unless necessary).
* Format your code using Prettier:

  ```bash
  pnpm prettier --write .
  ```
* Run ESLint before committing:

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```

---

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have an idea for improvement?

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. If none exists, [open a new issue](https://github.com/F4P1E/lab68dev-platform/issues/new).
   Include:

   * Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug)
   * Expected vs actual behavior
   * Screenshots or logs (if relevant)
   * Suggestion or context

> Be clear, concise, and respectful — remember we’re all here to build together.
